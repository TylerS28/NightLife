just a book script that was 10 dollars

in the html you can modify everything to your liking an also add pages

theres 2 types of pages

hard/soft

if you want hard do this

<div class="hard"><img src="portada.png" width="800" height="600"></div>


if you want soft do this

<div><img src="portada.png" width="800" height="600"></div>


How to open the book*, Here's the trigger

TriggerEvent('libro:libro')

or if you are doing it from the serverside just 

TriggerClientEvent('libro:libro', source)


that's it, thanks!
you're welcome to do anything you want to it except leaking it and reselling it.
