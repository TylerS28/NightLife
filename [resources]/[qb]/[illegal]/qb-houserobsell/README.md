# Simple Selling Script

* This script I made it for my server for the pawnshop job. It is a player owned business where people come in to sell their stolen goods. The pawnshop employee sells their items, they receive cash and give the money to the seller. With the current configuration, 30% of the total price goes to the boss menu. 

* You can make it for any job or you can remove that altogether allowing anyone to sell to the ped.

* You can change the location of the ped on client.lua (make sure to create a new zone and spawn a ped)

* You can add more items on the Config.
